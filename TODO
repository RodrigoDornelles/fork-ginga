* KNOWN BUGS
  + player::Player: Dimension properties are treated as being orthogonal.
    Currently, we process "top", "left", "right", "bottom", "width",
    "height", "location", "bounds", and "size" in declaration order, but
    they are not independent.  For instance, "right" depends on "width" and
    "bottom" depends on "height".  These dependencies should be taken into
    account when implementing property changes.

  + common.cpp: xstrtodorpercent should fail.
    This function should return an error when receiving an invalid number
    string.

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS
  + Property attributions originated by NCLua scripts are not supported.
  + Areas containing the attribute "label" are not supported.
  + Focus navigation is not supported.
  + NCL media objects are not supported.
  + Element <descriptorSwitch> is not supported.
