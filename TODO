* KNOWN BUGS
  + player::VideoPlayer: Natural end does not work.
  + player::Player: Dimension properties are treated as being orthogonal.

    Currently, we process "top", "left", "right", "bottom", "width",
    "height", "location", "bounds", and "size" in declaration order, but
    they are not independent.  For instance, "right" depends on "width" and
    "bottom" depends on "height".  These dependencies should be taken into
    account when implementing property changes.

* FEATURES OR PROBLEMS
  + Properties "visible" are not supported.
  + Areas containing the attribute are not supported.
