 * A Lua Node can register himself to handle EPG events (class='si', type='epg').

 *
 * 1) stage='current', fields={field_1, field_2,...field_j}
 * 2) stage='next', eventId=<number>, fields={field_1, field_2,...field_j}
 * 3) stage='schedule', startTime=<date>, endTime=<date>, fields={field_1,
 * 		field_2,...field_j}
 *
 * The struct Request was create to model a lua node request for EPG events.
 * That request has to be stored associated with her N IEPGListeners.
